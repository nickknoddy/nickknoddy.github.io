# Clustering

## Unsupervised Learning: Introduction

- The data in the supervised learning problems comes with labels

  ![Supervised Learning.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/supervised-learning.png)

- The data in the unsupervised learning problems doesn't come with the labels

- Unsupervised learning algorithms are meant to find the structure in the dataset

- Clustering algorithm is used find groups of data point on the dataset

## K-Means Algorithm

- This is a Clustering Algorithm

- Steps

  - Cluster Centroids

    ![Cluster Centroids.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/cluster-centroids.png)

  - Random Initialisation

    ![Random Initialisation.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/random-initialisation.png)

  - Mark a new cluster according to the points nearer to the centroids

  - Move Centroids to the average of new cluster

    ![Move To The Average.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/move-to-the-average.png)

  - Repeat until the centroid doesn't change

    ![Repeat.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/repeat.png)

- K-Means Algorithm

  - Input

    - K - number of clusters

    - Training Set

    ![K Means Algorithm.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/k-means-algorithm.png)

  - Overview Steps

    ![K Means Algorithm Extended.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/k-means-algorithm-extended.png)

  - For Non-Separated Data

    ![Non Separated Clusters.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/non-separated-clusters.png)

## Optimisation Objective

- Optimisation Objective

  - Minimise the distance between the actual point and the centroid of the cluster associated

  ![Optimism Objective.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/optimisation-objective.png)

- Algorithm

  - First part of the algorithm consist of minimising cost function with respect to c^i holding u_k fixed

  - Second part of the algorithm consist of minimising cost function with respect to u_k

  ![Algorithm.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/algorithm.png)

## Random Initialisation

- Random Initialisation

  - Should have K < m
  - Randomly pick K training examples
  - Set u_1....u_k to these K examples

  ![RI.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/ri.png)

- Local Optima

  - K-Means can get stuck at local optima

  ![Local Optima.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/local-optima.png)

- Random Initialisation Extended

  - Run K-Means for n number of times

    - n = 50 to 1000

  - Pick the iteration which gives the minimum cost function

## Choosing the Number of Clusters

- What is the right value of K ?

- Other Method

  - Choosing the value of K based on the application

# Motivation

## Motivation 1: Data Compression

- Data Compression

  - Compressing the size of the data

  ![Data Compression.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/data-compression.png)

- 2D to 1D

  ![2D - 1D.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/2d-1d.png)

- 3D to 2D

  ![3D - 2D.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/3d-2d.png)

## Motivation 2: Visualisation

- Data Visualisation

  - Dataset of countries with many features

  ![Data Visualisation 1.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/data-visualisation-1.png)

  - Converting 50 D to 2 D

  ![Data Visualisation 2.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/data-visualisation-2.png)

  - Plotting the dataset

# Principal Component Analysis

## Principal Component Analysis Problem Formulation

- PCA

  - Dimension Reductionality Algorithm

  ![PCA.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/pca.png)

  - Problem Formulation

  ![PCA Problem Formulation.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/pca-problem-formulation.png)

- PCA is not Linear Regression

  - In linear regression, the error is draw 90 degree from the line to the data point

  - In PCA, the projection error is drawn at a angle from the line to the data point

  ![PCA vs LR.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/pca-vs-lr.png)

  - Reducing dimension of data

  - Compute 'Covariance Matrix'

  - Compute 'eigenvectors' of matrix

# Applying PCA

## Reconstruction from Compressed Representation

![Reconstruction from Compressed Representation.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/reconstruction-from-compressed-representation.png)

## Choosing the Number of Principal Components

- Choosing k ( number of principal components )

  - Average squared projection error / Total variation in the data â‰¤ 0.01

  - 99 % of variance is retained

  ![Choosing k.png](/assets/images/ml-andrew-ng-week-8/choosing-k.png)
